- Should be production-ready dev-wise, since the pokeAPI is open source and doesn't require a key to set up in the environment it does have some fair use restrictions that our cache implementation should take care of.
- Also worth mentioning I wouldn't sent this to prod before adding unit tests and have a QA breaking things up.
